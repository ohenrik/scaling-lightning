The scaling-lightning binary can be downloaded from [https://github.com/scaling-lightning/scaling-lightning/releases](https://github.com/scaling-lightning/scaling-lightning/releases). Please read the [README](https://github.com/scaling-lightning/scaling-lightning) for prerequisites such as helm and installing traefik on your cluster.\\n\\n```shell\\nscaling-lightning start -f network.yaml\\n```\\n\\n{eer up Alice and Carol and open a channel and send some initial funds that can be sent back and forth.\\n\\n```shell\\nscaling-lightning send -f bitcoind -t alice -a 1000000\\nscaling-lightning connectpeer -f alice -t bob\\nscaling-lightning openchannel -f alice -t bob -a 100000\\nscaling-lightning createinvoice -n bob -a 50000\\nscaling-lightning payinvoice -n alice -i <bolt11 invoice>\\n```\\n\\nScaling Lightning cluster should be running with Alice and Bob having a channel between them.\\n\\n## SimLN setup\\n\\n[SimLN](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/sim-ln) also requires a config file.\\n\\n```shell\\ngit clone https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/sim-ln\\ncd sim-ln\\n```\\n\\nThen create config file for SimLN to give it the identity of nodes in the Scaling Lightning cluster.\\n\\n```json title=\\"config.json\\"\\n{\\n  \\"nodes\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"LND\\": {\\n        \\"id\\": \\"0248efcfe94e3c451f4995b471ef0707163f279d4681af23727279c9c696004b42\\",\\n        \\"address\\": \\"https://localhost:28102\\",\\n        \\"macaroon\\": \\"/Users/max/source/sim-ln/auth/bob/admin.macaroon\\",\\n        \\"cert\\": \\"/Users/max/source/sim-ln/auth/bob/tls.cert\\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"CLN\\": {\\n        \\"id\\": \\"0221b76f4cce7ab42538127022bac6245e999804ab5901813d9337d5cadd6428df\\",\\n        \\"address\\": \\"https://localhost:28101\\",\\n        \\"ca_cert\\": \\"/Users/max/source/sim-ln/auth/alice/ca.pem\\",\\n        \\"client_cert\\": \\"/Users/max/source/sim-ln/auth/alice/client.pem\\",\\n        \\"client_key\\": \\"/Users/max/source/sim-ln/auth/alice/client-key.pem\\"\\n      }\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\"activity\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"source\\": \\"0248efcfe94e3c451f4995b471ef0707163f279d4681af23727279c9c696004b42\\",\\n      \\"destination\\": \\"0221b76f4cce7ab42538127022bac6245e999804ab5901813d9337d5cadd6428de\\",\\n      \\"interval_secs\\": 1,\\n      \\"amount_msat\\": 2000\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"source\\": \\"0221b76f4cce7ab42538127022bac6245e999804ab5901813d9337d5cadd6428de\\",\\n      \\"destination\\": \\"0248efcfe94e3c451f4995b471ef0707163f279d4681af23727279c9c696004b42\\",\\n      \\"interval_secs\\": 1,\\n      \\"amount_msat\\": 2000\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo create your version of this config file you need three things: pubkey, address+port of GRPC api and auth files. Scaling Lightning has three commands for that.\\n\\n```shell\\nscaling-lightning writeauthfiles -o ~/source/sim-ln/auth --all\\nscaling-lightning pubkey -n alice\\nscaling-lightning pubkey -n bob\\nscaling-lightning connectiondetails --all\\n```\\n\\nFinally to run SimLN\\n\\n```shell\\ncargo install --path sim-cli/\\nsim-cli --log-level debug --config config.json\\n```\\n\\nWe will be following the development of SimLN closely. Scaling Lightning will need it\'s own activity generator and perhaps that could be SimLN?\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y0uwYV_Bx7w?si=8YaCKdx9UQhw0NQp\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"id":"/2023/08/26/roadmap","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/08/26/roadmap","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-26-roadmap.md","title":"Initial Project Roadmap","description":"The motivation to establish Scaling Lightning has stemmed from the recognition that the testing of lightning networks poses considerable challenges, necessitating substantial development efforts.
